# Federated and Ensembled Reinforcement Learning on Micro UAVs
Completed as part of my summer REU at Columbia University under the supervision of Dr. Brian Plancher. Serves as a universal platform for ensembled federated deep reinforcement
learning with many options for customization. 
## Note:
Due to domain randomization, this platform works with my modified version of stable_baselines3 and gym-pybullet-drones. You will find these packages here:
